## How to detect infinite reach hacks
 
Infinite reach hacks are hard to spot, but there are some signs that can help you identify them. Here are some of them:
 
- The hacker can hit you or your cake from a distance that is impossible for a normal player.
- The hacker can hit you through walls or other obstacles.
- The hacker can hit you even when you are moving or dodging.
- The hacker can hit you multiple times in a row without missing.
- The hacker can hit you faster than a normal player.

If you notice any of these signs, you should record a video of the hacker and report them to the Mineplex staff. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the Mineplex website and log in with your account[^3^].
2. Click on the "Report" tab at the top of the page.
3. Fill out the report form with the hacker's username, the game mode (Cake Wars), the date and time of the incident, and a link to your video evidence.
4. Submit your report and wait for a response from the staff.

## Why hacking is bad for the game and the community
 
Hacking is not only cheating, but also disrespectful and harmful to the game and the community. Here are some reasons why hacking is bad:

- Hacking ruins the fun and fairness of the game for everyone else.
- Hacking gives hackers an undeserved advantage over honest players.
- Hacking discourages new players from joining or staying in the game.
- Hacking damages the reputation and credibility of Mineplex as a gaming platform.
- Hacking violates the rules and terms of service of Mineplex and can result in bans or legal actions.

Therefore, we urge you to not hack or support hackers in any way. Instead, play fair and enjoy the game as it is meant to be played.
